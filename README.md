# AFOX-HIP-Africa-Oxford-Health-Innovation-Platform-

The Africa Oxford Health Innovation Platform (AfOx-HIP) is a multi-disciplinary programme to support African innovators develop new solutions to Africa’s health challenges. 

AfOx-HIP is an extension of Africa-Oxford collaborations aimed at connecting research to industry to solve intractable societal challenges. AfOx-HIP helps ideas come to life as real solutions to big challenges through innovation and entrepreneurship by pursuing a broader purpose for sustainable futures. The shifting societal perceptions aligned to creating and sustaining value in the world provide an opportunity for promoting pursuit of purpose through impact investment and innovation.

## AfOx-HIP focus areas in health innovation ##

AfOx-HIP is open to work in any scientific discipline, including outside life sciences and engineering sciences, and any type of technology leading to the creation of solutions towards disease prevention, diagnosis, management and treatment.

Examples of technologies include:

Therapeutics - Vaccines - Devices - Digital technologies - Diagnostics

Solutions should demonstrate strong potential for health systems strengthening, and particularly, significant improvement in healthcare equity and access. Applications are open to all areas relevant to Africa’s health challenges.  Novel solutions relating to maternal and neonatal care to improve mortality and morbidity outcomes; medical laboratory-related testing and diagnostic capacity to support treatment, monitoring and control of pathogens and to increase resilience to endemic diseases; and zoonotic disease-related solutions are highly encouraged.

AfOx-HIP will identify outstanding emerging African researchers and innovators, proposing new solutions for health and facilitate their interaction with partners across Oxford, for the AfOx Innovation and Entrepreneurship Scheme.
